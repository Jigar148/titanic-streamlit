     🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction App
     This repository contains a Python-based web application that predicts Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. Built with Streamlit, the app takes user inputs such as age, gender, class, fare, and more, and predicts survival using a **Random Forest classifier** trained on the Titanic dataset.

   📦 Files Included
     - app.py: Main Streamlit app file.
     - requirements.txt: Lists all required Python libraries for easy setup.
